# IPFIX-RITA

IPFIX-RITA is a system for processing IPFIX/Netflow v9/Netflow v5 records for
use with [RITA](https://github.com/activecm/rita).


NOTICE: IPFIX-RITA is still in beta, it has only been tested on a limited
number of devices.

# Installing IPFIX-RITA

### Preliminaries

First, ensure you have a working installation of RITA and MongoDB. For the best
performance, it is suggested that IPFIX-RITA is installed on a machine separate
from RITA and MongoDB. However, if performance is not a great concern, it is
often practical to install everything in one place.

**You must ensure the RITA database can be contacted on an IP address other
than localhost**. This can be done by editing the `bindIP` setting in
`/etc/mongod.conf`. The installer will prompt you to ensure this change is made
before continuing on.  If you intend to install IPFIX-RITA on the same machine 
as RITA and MongoDB, please add the IP address suggested by the installer.

#### How to [Install RITA](https://github.com/activecm/rita#automatic-installation)

\
The IPFIX-RITA installer should run on most Linux distributions provided
**Docker (min v17.06+)** and **docker-compose (min v1.17)** are installed.
#### How to [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
#### How to [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing

Download the latest archive from the [releases page](https://github.com/activecm/ipfix-rita/releases),
unpack it, and run the installation script with administrator privileges.

#### Download latest archive
```
$ wget $(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/activecm/ipfix-rita/releases/latest" \
| grep '"browser_download_url":' | cut -d \" -f 4 ) -O ipfix-rita.tgz
```

#### Upack the installer
```
$ tar -zxf ipfix-rita.tgz
```

#### Run the installer
```
$ sudo $(ls -d */ | grep "ipfix-rita" | head -1)install-ipfix-rita.sh
```

You will be prompted for configuration details regarding the RITA database
connection and the names of the resulting datasets. Further configuration
options can be set in `/etc/ipfix-rita/converter/converter.yaml`.

By default, **IPFIX-RITA will run at start up unless it is stopped**. For more 
information see [Additional Info](docs/Additional%20Info.md). Full
documentation for IPFIX-RITA can be found in the [docs](docs/) folder.
